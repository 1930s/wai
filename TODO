HTML sitemap generation
Cleanup Data.Object.Translate
Remove Data.Object.Instances (Web.Types?)
Possibly unify ResourceName and RestfulApp?
Expand Yesod.Definitions?
Cleanup Parameter stuff. Own module? Interface with formlets?
Merge MonadRequestReader class with other Handler stuff
SitemapLoc: what's the point again?
Authentication via e-mail address built in. (eaut.org)
OpenID 2 stuff (for direct Google login).
Simple model information (settings files, etc) in RestfulApp
Is there a mimetype package on hackage for Yesod.Helpers.Static?
The RepT stuff is hideous.
More than one type of objectResponse?
Native support for HStringTemplate.
Automatic HTML escaping, something smart for templates vs JSON.
Handler should be a better type, do something about ToHandler.
